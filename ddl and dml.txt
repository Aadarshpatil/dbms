Part a: Design and Develop SQL DDL Statements
Below is the SQL DDL (Data Definition Language) for demonstrating the use of SQL objects such as Table, View, Index, Sequence, Synonym, and different constraints on the given Departments and Employees tables.

1. Create the Departments Table
sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE Departments (
    dept_id INT PRIMARY KEY,               -- Primary key constraint
    dept_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,        -- Not null constraint
    location VARCHAR(100)                  -- Location can be null
);
2. Create the Employees Table
sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE Employees (
    emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,                 -- Primary key constraint
    emp_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,          -- Not null constraint
    emp_salary DECIMAL(10, 2) CHECK (emp_salary > 0),  -- Check constraint to ensure salary is positive
    hire_date DATE DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE,     -- Default constraint to set the current date
    dept_id INT,                             -- Foreign key to departments table
    CONSTRAINT fk_dept FOREIGN KEY (dept_id) REFERENCES Departments(dept_id)  -- Foreign key constraint
);
3. Create a View
A view that combines data from both Employees and Departments, showing employee details along with department names.

sql
Copy code
CREATE VIEW EmployeeDepartmentView AS
SELECT e.emp_id, e.emp_name, e.emp_salary, e.hire_date, d.dept_name, d.location
FROM Employees e
JOIN Departments d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id;
4. Create an Index on emp_name
Creating an index on emp_name in the Employees table to improve search performance for employee names.

sql
Copy code
CREATE INDEX idx_emp_name ON Employees (emp_name);
5. Create a Sequence for Generating Employee IDs
In MySQL, sequences are not directly supported as they are in other databases like Oracle. However, auto-incrementing columns serve the same purpose. For demonstration, we can simulate a sequence by setting an AUTO_INCREMENT property on the emp_id.

sql
Copy code
-- Altering emp_id to AUTO_INCREMENT to simulate a sequence.
ALTER TABLE Employees MODIFY emp_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT;
6. Create a Synonym (Optional)
In MySQL, Synonyms are not directly supported. However, we can create aliases for objects using views or other techniques. But for illustrative purposes, here's how we could "simulate" a synonym:

sql
Copy code
-- Create a view that acts as a synonym for the Departments table.
CREATE VIEW Dept AS SELECT * FROM Departments;
Part b: Write 10 SQL Queries Using DML Statements
Here are 10 SQL queries using SQL DML (Data Manipulation Language) on the given Departments and Employees tables.

1. Insert a New Department
Insert a new department record into the Departments table.

sql
Copy code
INSERT INTO Departments (dept_id, dept_name, location)
VALUES (5, 'Finance', 'London');
2. Insert Multiple Employee Records
Insert multiple records into the Employees table.

sql
Copy code
INSERT INTO Employees (emp_id, emp_name, emp_salary, dept_id, hire_date)
VALUES
(7, 'Grace', 70000.00, 3, '2023-02-15'),
(8, 'Hannah', 65000.00, 4, '2022-11-08');
3. Update an Employee's Salary
Update the salary of employee emp_id = 3 (Charlie).

sql
Copy code
UPDATE Employees
SET emp_salary = 80000.00
WHERE emp_id = 3;
4. Update a Department Location
Update the location of the department with dept_id = 2 (Sales) to 'Los Angeles'.

sql
Copy code
UPDATE Departments
SET location = 'Los Angeles'
WHERE dept_id = 2;
5. Delete an Employee Record
Delete the employee with emp_id = 6 (Frank).

sql
Copy code
DELETE FROM Employees
WHERE emp_id = 6;
6. Retrieve All Employees with Their Department Name
Use a join to retrieve employee details along with their department name.

sql
Copy code
SELECT e.emp_id, e.emp_name, e.emp_salary, e.hire_date, d.dept_name
FROM Employees e
JOIN Departments d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id;
7. Retrieve Employees with Salary Greater Than a Specified Amount
Retrieve all employees who earn more than 60,000.

sql
Copy code
SELECT emp_id, emp_name, emp_salary
FROM Employees
WHERE emp_salary > 60000;
8. Count the Number of Employees in Each Department
Use GROUP BY and COUNT to find out how many employees are in each department.

sql
Copy code
SELECT d.dept_name, COUNT(e.emp_id) AS num_employees
FROM Departments d
LEFT JOIN Employees e ON d.dept_id = e.dept_id
GROUP BY d.dept_name;
9. Find the Highest Paid Employee in Each Department
Find the highest-paid employee in each department.

sql
Copy code
SELECT e.dept_id, e.emp_name, e.emp_salary
FROM Employees e
WHERE e.emp_salary = (
    SELECT MAX(emp_salary)
    FROM Employees
    WHERE dept_id = e.dept_id
);
10. Retrieve Employee Details with Department Location Using a View
Assuming the EmployeeDepartmentView was created earlier, this query retrieves employee details along with their department location.

sql
Copy code
SELECT * FROM EmployeeDepartmentView;
Explanation:
Inserts: Queries to add new data to both Departments and Employees.
Updates: Modifies existing records in the tables (Employees and Departments).
Deletes: Removes records from the Employees table.
Select Queries:
Joins Employees and Departments to get detailed employee information.
Filters employees based on their salary.
Groups employees by department and counts them.
Aggregate Functions: COUNT() to find the number of employees in each department, and MAX() to find the highest-paid employee per department.
View: A view (EmployeeDepartmentView) combines employee and department details for easy querying.
